# Ansible For GEM

This repository is my testing ground for ansible. The objective is to create an ansible playbook that will load necessary software from a control host onto a CTP7 or GLIB.

## Pre-instructions

Make sure that you are logged into the control host and that it has ansible installed. Make sure that the CTP7/GLIB addresses are recorded in `/etc/ansible/hosts`
